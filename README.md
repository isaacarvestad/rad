# Rust Algorithms and Data structures

Various algorithms and data structures implemented in Rust.

## Build
To build and test the library run:
``` shell
cargo build && cargo test
```

## Implemented
- [x] Disjoint set (also known as Union Find)
- [x] Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- [ ] Sequence
  - [x] Edit Distance
  - [x] Longest Common Subsequence
  - [ ] Longest Increasing Subsequence
- [ ] Graph
  - [x] Shortest path/distance with non-negative edge weights (Dijkstra)
  - [ ] Shortest path/distance between two vertices (Bellman-Ford)
  - [ ] All pairs shortest path (Floyd-Warshall)
